    Lisa Stoddard is a human-environment geographer who is interested in the intersection of nature, society, and social justice. Stoddardâ€™s interest and research on social justice extends into the classroom, including research on critical pedagogies, STEM
    and social justice, and creating inclusive spaces and practices for learning. Stoddard has been the recipient of multiple grants to examine issues of bias and stereotyping on student academic project teams, and the impact this has on student learning
    and experience. Through this work, Stoddard, and colleague Geoff Pfeifer, have developed a set of modules and tools to create more equitable team dynamics for use by both students and faculty. A description of some of this work can be found in the
