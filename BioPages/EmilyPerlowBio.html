    Emily Perlow is Assistant Dean of Students. She works at WPI to manage the CARE program, support student conduct, and advance the Student Affairs Division strategic planning and assessment efforts in addition to supporting the work of Student Activities
    and Dining Services. One of her favorite functions is to analyze the environment on campus and to work to remove barriers that affect student success. She received a doctorate from the University Massachusetts-Amherst, completing a dissertation exploring
    the relationships between hazing, masculine norm conformity, and adult play. She also holds a Master’s Degree in College Student Personnel from Bowling Green State University and a Bachelor’s Degree in Anthropology from The Ohio State University.
    She has volunteered as chair of the Northeast Greek Leadership Association Board of Directors for the past 9 years, as a Harm Prevention Specialist, Education Committee Chairman, and Director of Volunteer Development for Alpha Gamma Delta, and currently
    serves as Chair of the Association of Fraternity Advisors Research Committee and incoming chair of the NASPA Fraternity/Sorority Knowledge Community. As a scholar-practitioner, her interests include analyzing systems, processes and cultures that inhibit
    student success, enhancing the experiences of marginalized populations in the STEM pipeline, deviant behavior among college populations, particularly hazing, and masculine expression among college men.
